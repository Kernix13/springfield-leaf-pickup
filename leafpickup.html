      <p>Below is the current year leaf collection schedule. Every year 2 precincts are rotated from the bottom of the
        schedule to the top of the schedule. Rotating the schedule each year ensures that no precincts are always the
        first or last each year.</p>
      <!-- Is this correct? Precinct = Zone + Ward? I added this, feel free to remove it -->
      <p>*Zone = Precinct + Ward ( or maybe<em> Ward + Precinct</em> )</p>
      <p>The numbers below are a combination of the Zone number and Ward number. For example, Precinct 4-1 is Zone 4 and
        Ward 1, or 4-1.</p>

      <h2>Assumptions made in creating this schedule</h2>
      <p class="final-text">My name is Jim Kernicky and I have a web design business. I also live in Springfield and
        created this schedule app for myself. I contacted the township via email but never heard back from them on some
        of my questions. Here are the assumptions I had to make to create this schedule:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The 1st week of leaf pickup is the week of the first Monday in November (<em>this is incorrect</em>).</li>
        <li>The # of precints do not increase or decrease.</li>
        <li>The order that precincts follow in the schedule is constant and does not change.</li>
        <li>The # of precincts per week does not change: 3 precincts for the two holiday weeks, 4 precincts for the
          other weeks.</li>
        <li>The # of weeks of leaf pickup (currently 6) does not change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="final-text"><a href="https://everyguitarchord.com/contact/" target="_blank">Contact me</a> if you know
        that 1 or more of those assumptions are wrong.</p>
